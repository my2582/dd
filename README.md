# Due-diligence
I conducted due-diligence on nine hedge fund managers in New York with my colleagues and analysts at Albournce in April 2011. I wrote a full report about it, which obvisouly I am not allowed to share with here. Probably listing up questions in that report would be the best I can do to give you sense of my work.

## Questions in the due-diligence report
#### 1) How to calculate portfolio NAVs
- Is NAV pricing calculated by an independent fund service?
- What is your internal process when discrepency occurs in NAV pricing between your firm and the independent fund service?
- Historical records of re-announcing NAVs.
  - According to Stephen Brown(2011), 10% of hedge fund managers in average modifies a portfolio NAV at least once.

#### 2) Money transaction control
- The number of signatures required to complete money transactions. 
  - According to Stephen Brown(2011), an average of 1.7 signatures is needed.
- Limitation of receipiant imposed
- Existance of the 3rd-party reviewing money transactions

#### 3) Fund structures
- General information such as prime brokers, auditors, undisclosed investment activies in feeder funds (rather than mother funds) and etc.

#### 4) Operational Risk
- A turnover ratio
- Is your auditor one of Big 4?
- History of changing prime brokers, auditors and custodian banks.

#### 5) Market/Credit Risk
- Your definition of leverage
- Limits on leverage
- How to leverage (Creditline? Colateral? Derivatives?)
- Limits on loans
- Risk limits (on single positions, concentrations, country or sector levels and etc).
